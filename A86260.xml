            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> The ≈øtroke of Gods wrath for the ≈øinnes of mankinde. This is not onely the opinion of Divines, but of all learned Phy≈øitians, and acknowledged by the blinde Heathen in all ages, by the light of nature.

<pb facs="tcp:154194:7"/> effect thereof. And till this be performed, what other wayes ≈øoever wee ≈øhall follow, wee ≈øhall begin at the wrong end:
<q xml:lang="lat">

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> There ≈øhould (in my opinion) be provided a place of Sepulture for the bodies e≈øpecially of ≈øuch as die by the Sicknes, ≈øome good di≈øtance from the Citie and Suburbs. The burying of infected bodies in Churches, Church-yards, and namely in <hi>Paules</hi> Church-yard, where the chiefe Magi≈øtrates of the Citie, and many other Citizens meete weekly to heare Sermons, mu≈øt needs be not onely inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but very dangerous for ≈øpreading the contagion, and poi≈øoning the whole Citie. For all men that have the lea≈øt in≈øight in Philo≈øophy know, that from the dead corps, by force of the Sunne, certaine va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours or exhalations are elevated, which partake of the nature of tho≈øe bodies, and doe undoubtedly taint, corrupt, and poy≈øon the aire with their ill qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. For this principall cau≈øe, in mo≈øt well ordered Cities of forrein Countries, there is a common place of Buriall appointed a good di≈øtance from the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Citie. And till this may be procured for our Citie, I wi≈øh that ≈øtraight charge be given, that
<pb facs="tcp:154194:7"/> all dead corp≈øes be layd a convenient depth in the ground, and not one coffin heaped upon another, and they layd ≈øo neare the top of the earth as (it is to be feared) they now are.</p>
            <p>It were nece≈ø≈øarie the place of Buriall ≈øhould be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> on the South ≈øide of the Citie, that the Sunne may draw the vapours from it.</p>
            <p>Let care be had, that the ≈øtreets, e≈øpecially the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> lanes and allies, be kept from annoyance of dung-hilles, vaults or hou≈øes of office, the common ≈øewers and chanels be well purged and ≈øcowred, the dung-farmers tyed to their ≈øtint of time in Winter, and not ≈øuffered (unle≈ø≈øe urgent nece≈ø≈øitie require) to perfume the ≈øtreets all Summer long, e≈øpecially in this time of contagion. Let not the carka≈ø≈øes of hor≈øes, dogs, cats, &amp;c. lye rotting and poy≈øoning the ayre (as they have done) in More and Finsburie fields, and el≈øewhere round about the Citie.</p>
            <p>Let the Pipes layd from the new River be often <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> opened, to clen≈øe the channels of every ≈øtreete in the Citie.</p>

            <p>Let the ayre be purged and corrected, e≈øpecially <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> in evenings which are ≈øomewhat cold, and in places low and neare the River (as Thames ≈øtreet and the Allyes there about) by making fires of Oken or A≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, with ≈øome few bundles of Iuniper ca≈øt into them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:154194:8"/>
            <p>Let men in their private hou≈øes, amend the aire by laying in their windowes ≈øweet herbes, as Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joram, Time,<note place="margin">Let them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe rub their windowes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with worm wood and fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell.</note> Ro≈øemarie, Balme, Fennell, Peniroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, Mints, &amp;c.
