            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> The ſtroke of Gods wrath for the ſinnes of mankinde. This is not onely the opinion of Divines, but of all learned Phyſitians, and acknowledged by the blinde Heathen in all ages, by the light of nature.

The cauſe remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, who can looke for the taking away of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect? Let me therefore be an humble ſuitor, that your Highneſſe would be pleaſed to command a generall humiliation of the people by prayer and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. This action as it would be honourable to your Majeſtie, and ſuch as you would undoubtedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcend unto moſt readily and willingly, if it were but mentioned and moved; ſo in my perſwaſion, there would appeare a moſt admirable and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb facs="tcp:154194:7"/> effect thereof. And till this be performed, what other wayes ſoever wee ſhall follow, wee ſhall begin at the wrong end:
<q xml:lang="lat">
                  <l>Ni Deus affuerit, vireſque infuderit Herbis,</l>
                  <l>Quid cedò Diptamús, quid Panacea juvat?</l>
               </q> Let not Gentlemen and rich Citizens by flying (unleſſe they likewiſe flie from their ſinnes) thinke to eſcape Scotfree. So long as they carry their ſinne with them, the Lord will find them out, and his hand will reach them whereſoever they are.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> There ſhould (in my opinion) be provided a place of Sepulture for the bodies eſpecially of ſuch as die by the Sicknes, ſome good diſtance from the Citie and Suburbs. The burying of infected bodies in Churches, Church-yards, and namely in <hi>Paules</hi> Church-yard, where the chiefe Magiſtrates of the Citie, and many other Citizens meete weekly to heare Sermons, muſt needs be not onely inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but very dangerous for ſpreading the contagion, and poiſoning the whole Citie. For all men that have the leaſt inſight in Philoſophy know, that from the dead corps, by force of the Sunne, certaine va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours or exhalations are elevated, which partake of the nature of thoſe bodies, and doe undoubtedly taint, corrupt, and poyſon the aire with their ill qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. For this principall cauſe, in moſt well ordered Cities of forrein Countries, there is a common place of Buriall appointed a good diſtance from the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Citie. And till this may be procured for our Citie, I wiſh that ſtraight charge be given, that
<pb facs="tcp:154194:7"/> all dead corpſes be layd a convenient depth in the ground, and not one coffin heaped upon another, and they layd ſo neare the top of the earth as (it is to be feared) they now are.</p>
            <p>It were neceſſarie the place of Buriall ſhould be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> on the South ſide of the Citie, that the Sunne may draw the vapours from it.</p>
            <p>Let care be had, that the ſtreets, eſpecially the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> lanes and allies, be kept from annoyance of dung-hilles, vaults or houſes of office, the common ſewers and chanels be well purged and ſcowred, the dung-farmers tyed to their ſtint of time in Winter, and not ſuffered (unleſſe urgent neceſſitie require) to perfume the ſtreets all Summer long, eſpecially in this time of contagion. Let not the carkaſſes of horſes, dogs, cats, &amp;c. lye rotting and poyſoning the ayre (as they have done) in More and Finsburie fields, and elſewhere round about the Citie.</p>
            <p>Let the Pipes layd from the new River be often <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> opened, to clenſe the channels of every ſtreete in the Citie.</p>
            <p>Let the Ditches towards the ſuburbs, eſpecially <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> towards <hi>Iſlington</hi> and Pick-hatch, Old-ſtreete, and towards Shoreditch and White-chappell, be well clenſed, and if it might be, the water of the new River to runne through them, as alſo the like to be done through the Burrough of South-worke.</p>
            <p>Let the ayre be purged and corrected, eſpecially <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> in evenings which are ſomewhat cold, and in places low and neare the River (as Thames ſtreet and the Allyes there about) by making fires of Oken or Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, with ſome few bundles of Iuniper caſt into them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:154194:8"/>
            <p>Let men in their private houſes, amend the aire by laying in their windowes ſweet herbes, as Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joram, Time,<note place="margin">Let them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe rub their windowes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with worm wood and fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell.</note> Roſemarie, Balme, Fennell, Peniroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, Mints, &amp;c. Likewiſe by burning Iuniper, Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie, Time, Bay-leaves, Cloves, Cinamon, or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing other compound perfumes. The poorer ſort may burne Worme-wood, Rue, Time. Let them caſt often on the floores of their houſes water min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with Vineger.</p>
            <p>Concourſe of people to Stage-playes, Wakes or Feaſts, and May-pole dauncings, are to be prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by publique Authoritie, whereby as God is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored, the bodies of men and women by ſurfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, drunkennes, and other riots and exceſſes, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to infection, and the contagion dangerouſly ſcattered both in Citie and Countrie.</p>
            <p>Let the Bells in Cities and Townes be rung often, and the great Ordnance diſcharged, thereby the aire is purified.</p>
            <p>Touching our regiment and diet, repletion and inanition (as two dangerous extremities) are heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be avoyded. Thoſe meats are to be uſed which are of eaſie digeſtion and apt to breed good juice.</p>
            <p>The blankets, matreſſes, flockbeds, and all bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes of the infected, are to be burned, alſo leather garments, becauſe they hold the infection very long. <hi>Alexander Benedictus</hi> reports,<note place="margin">Hiſt. de Peſt.</note> 
               <hi>That in</hi> Venice, <hi>a flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed uſed in a contagious time, was after 7 yeares found in an inward roome, the Miſtris of the houſe commanded the ſervants to ayre and beat it, whereupon the ſervants were inſtantly infected with the peſtilence and died.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:154194:8"/>

The rather becauſe I feare greatly, that through vaine confidence in them, other more appoſite, conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and effectuall Antidotes, and Alexeteries are neglected.</p>
               <p>My opinion is, that theſe Placents of Arſenicke carried about upon the Region of the heart, are ſo farre from effecting any good in that kinde, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative, that they are very dangerous and hurtfull, if not pernicious to thoſe that weare them.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:154194:10"/>
               <p>It is evident that Arſenicke being a confeſſed poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is an oppoſite,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. de Temp cap.</note> profeſſed and perpetuall enemy to our nature. Therefore being worne next the skin, as ſoone as the heart waxeth hot by any vehement motion, labour or ſtirring (as it falleth out uſually) it muſt needs ſend out venomous vapours to that noble and principall part; which will either pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate by their owne force, or be drawne in with the aire by the dilation of thoſe arteries which are ſpread about the skin.</p>
               <p>Now theſe poiſonfull vapours being entred or ſucked into the body, when they finde no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie poiſon with whom to wraſtle as with an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my (for if there were any venom in the body, the partie could not enjoy health: but we intend him to be in health, whom we would preſerve) they muſt needs imprint a malignant venomous qualitie in the ſpirits and heart, moſt adverſe and pernicious to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

This I certainly know, that diverſe who carrie about them quick-ſilver in a nut-ſhell, by the vaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of ſome impoſtors, have died of the Plague: and the counſellers of ſuch like Amulets have beene the firſt that have betaken themſelves to their heeles, truſting more in their running than cunning.

               <p>Hereunto (as a Corollary) wee may adde the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of ſome London Phyſitians, who have ſeene foule holes made in the breaſt of thoſe that have worne them, and obſerved diverſe to die as well as others, who have religiouſly carried them about their neckes.</p>
